"""Application Service for the Revisions domain.

The work package is judged first through the resolver every read uses. A revision belongs to the project of its
repository, which need not be the work package's project, so each row is then judged by its own project link and
a row outside the read scope is dropped.

Read scope reuses "work_package".
