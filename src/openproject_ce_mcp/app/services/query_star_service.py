"""Application Service for starring saved queries.

`starred` belongs to the query itself, not to the caller: starring a public query changes it for everyone. The
query is therefore judged like any other write: a query of a project needs that project in
OPENPROJECT_WRITE_PROJECTS and a public query without a project (a global one) needs the write scope `*`. A
private query is personal and may be starred only by its owner; a query whose owner cannot be told is refused.

OpenProject offers the `star` link only to a caller who may star the query and the `unstar` link only to one who
may unstar it, so the link of the wanted state is the permission check; the preview reads it as well, and a
preview never promises a write the confirmed call would refuse. A query already in the wanted state changes
nothing and is not written.

Read and write scope reuse "work_package": a saved query is a work package view.
